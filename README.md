# MyTorch
In this library, we implement all of Multilayer Perceptron (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network, and RNN. All using just numpy library. 
Implementing this architectures by mimicing the PyTorch helps understand the logic behind the widely used neural network architectures and
hence enabling to build any customized deep learning solution that is well-suited to the problem.
