# MyTorch
In this library, we implement all of Multilayer Perceptron (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network, and RNN. All using just numpy library. 
Implementing this libraries by mimicing the PyTorch helps understand the logic behinda the famous and widely used neural network architectures and
hence enabling to build any customized deep learning solution that is well-suited to the problem.
